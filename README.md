# Wayfair MCP Server Prototype

This prototype demonstrates how retailers can enhance AI agent experiences by providing structured access to their product data through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.

## Value Proposition

### Current State (Without MCP)
When AI agents like ChatGPT try to help users find products on Wayfair:
- Limited to web scraping and general search
- Inconsistent product information
- No access to real-time inventory, pricing, or availability
- Cannot perform actions like adding to cart or checking out
- Poor user experience with incomplete or outdated information

### Enhanced State (With MCP Server)
With a custom MCP server for Wayfair:
- Structured, reliable access to product data
- Real-time inventory and pricing information
- Ability to perform actions (search, filter, add to cart)
- Consistent, accurate product recommendations
- Better user experience with complete, up-to-date information

## Prototype Components

### 1. MCP Server (`wayfair_mcp_server.py`)
- Implements MCP protocol for Wayfair product data
- Provides tools for searching, filtering, and retrieving product information
- Simulates real API endpoints with structured data

### 2. Demo Scripts
- `demo_current_state.py`: Shows limitations of current ChatGPT approach
- `demo_enhanced_state.py`: Demonstrates improved experience with MCP server
- `product_data.json`: Sample product database for the prototype

### 3. Configuration
- `mcp_config.json`: MCP server configuration
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the MCP server:
```bash
python wayfair_mcp_server.py
```

3. Run the demo comparisons:
```bash
python demo_current_state.py
python demo_enhanced_state.py
```

## Use Cases Demonstrated

### Product Search
- **Current**: ChatGPT searches web, gets inconsistent results
- **Enhanced**: Direct access to structured product catalog with filters

### Product Comparison
- **Current**: Limited to general descriptions
- **Enhanced**: Detailed specifications, pricing, availability

### Shopping Cart Operations
- **Current**: Cannot perform actions
- **Enhanced**: Add items, manage cart, checkout process

### Inventory Checking
- **Current**: No real-time data
- **Enhanced**: Live inventory status and delivery estimates

## Business Impact

### For Retailers
- **Increased Conversion**: Better product discovery leads to more sales
- **Reduced Support**: AI agents can handle customer queries directly
- **Competitive Advantage**: First-mover advantage in AI agent integration
- **Data Control**: Maintain control over product presentation and pricing

### For Customers
- **Better Experience**: Accurate, up-to-date product information
- **Faster Decisions**: Quick access to relevant products
- **Reduced Friction**: Seamless shopping through AI agents

## Technical Implementation

The prototype uses:
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard interface for AI agent integration
- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for the server
- **Structured Data**: JSON-based product catalog
- **Tool Definitions**: Clear API for AI agent interactions

## Next Steps

1. **Real API Integration**: Connect to actual Wayfair API endpoints
2. **Authentication**: Implement secure access controls
3. **Scalability**: Handle high-volume requests
4. **Analytics**: Track usage and conversion metrics
5. **Multi-Retailer**: Extend to support multiple retailers
